## Overview

## Description

American Airlines travelers have the issue of not having a centralized place for making requests to flight attendants, in effect, the travelers have to wait at an interval amount of time to be able to place a request. These travelers also never know what's on the flight's amenities, this will also help slow the transmission of diseases.

## Goal

To have a centralized app for travelers to queue in requests for flight attendants, ultimately leading to a better traveling experience.

## App Evaluation

- Mobile: This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.

- Story: 
  - Users can send a request to the flight attendant.
